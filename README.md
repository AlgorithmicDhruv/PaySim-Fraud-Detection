# PaySim-Fraud-Detection
# Banking Fraud Detection Using PaySim Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a banking dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the PaySim dataset, which simulates mobile money transactions. The goal is to identify fraudulent activities while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the project.

## Features

- Implementation of various machine learning models including:
  - Random Forest
  - LightGBM
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
- Techniques used for handling imbalanced datasets:
  - Class weights
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Feature engineering using hashing for high cardinality columns.
